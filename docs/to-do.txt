Hollywood Animal — Save Editor: Next Steps / TODO

Completed (this session)
- Use formatUnitToTen for displaying skill levels and limits on all tabs
  (editing still saves normalized 0–1 values).
- Do not allow Limit to be set below current skill level in UI.
- For Movies, display year "0001" as "[unreleased]".
- Movies: show ratings in 0–10 format (internal 0–1 scaled).
- Replace ART/COM selects with sliders (0–1, step 0.01) and tick marks at
  0.000, 0.150, 0.300, 0.700, 1.000; display 0.0–10.0 values.
- Change tracking panel with Undo/Redo; global Download button hidden until changes.
- Avoid re-sorting while editing; sorting only updates on header clicks.
- Auto-collapse loaders once save and name map are both loaded.

Core Editing Expansion
- Add a detail page/view for each entity (Actor, Director, Movie, etc):
  - Show full record JSON with grouped sections (identity, professions, contracts, labels, tags, history)
  - Safe edits for additional fields (mood, attitude, selfEsteem, contracts)
  - Back link to list with deep-link support (hash routing)

- Movies: show ratings in 0–10 format (internal 0–1 scaled). Note there is
  a limiter that may cap the effective rating; audit the movie data object
  for other useful fields to surface in the UI.

UX / Quality
- Add inline reset per row/field and a global “revert unsaved changes” action.
- Provide per-field inline reset and global revert for all pending changes.
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility passes (aria roles, focus order, labels).
- Visual sort indicators already added; consider multi-column sort with modifier key.
- Tooltips on Age to show exact birthDate; show raw birthDate on hover.

Data Handling
- Streaming or targeted parsing for very large saves (extract only `characters` and needed subtrees).
- Guard against unexpected date formats and nulls; surface non-blocking warnings.
- Optional: configurable decimal precision (default three decimals) with consistent normalization.

Name Map
- Validate indices; highlight missing/invalid name IDs.
- Optional: support alternate local name map packages/languages.

Export / Safety
- Pre-export validation summary (changed fields count, potential anomalies).
- Optional: backup original file name + timestamp when downloading.

Technical / Code Health
- Factor common table rendering helpers and formatting utils.
- Add lightweight tests for parsing helpers (e.g., birthDate parse/format, game year detection).
- Linting/format sanity (no external tooling required; optional preconfigured tasks if added later).
- Consider TypeScript refactor if complexity grows (keep offline and simple).

Documentation
- Expand README with per-tab instructions once other tabs are implemented.
- Include JSON path references for each editable field on detail pages.
