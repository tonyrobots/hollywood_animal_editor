Hollywood Animal — Save Editor: Next Steps / TODO

Core Editing Expansion
- Implement other talent tabs (filter by professions):
  - Directors (professions.Director)
  - Producers (professions.Producer)
  - Writers (professions.Writer)
  - Editors (professions.Editor)
- Movies tab: list films with key fields (title, release date, art/com values where applicable) and basic edits.
- Add a detail page/view for each entity (Actor, Director, Movie):
  - Show full record JSON with grouped sections (identity, professions, contracts, labels, tags, history)
  - Safe edits for additional fields (mood, attitude, selfEsteem, contracts)
  - Back link to list with deep-link support (hash routing)

UX / Quality
- Add inline reset per row/field and a global “revert unsaved changes” action.
- Provide undo/redo stack for recent edits.
- Bulk operations (e.g., set ART/COM for selected items; adjust limits in range).
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility passes (aria roles, focus order, labels).
- Visual sort indicators already added; consider multi-column sort with modifier key.
- Persist UI state (search query, sort, active tab, game year) to localStorage.
- Tooltips on Age to show exact birthDate; show raw birthDate on hover.

Data Handling
- Streaming or targeted parsing for very large saves (extract only `characters` and needed subtrees).
- Guard against unexpected date formats and nulls; surface non-blocking warnings.
- Optional: configurable decimal precision (default three decimals) with consistent normalization.

Name Map
- Validate indices; highlight missing/invalid name IDs.
- Optional: support alternate local name map packages/languages.

Export / Safety
- Pre-export validation summary (changed fields count, potential anomalies).
- Optional: backup original file name + timestamp when downloading.

Technical / Code Health
- Factor common table rendering helpers and formatting utils.
- Add lightweight tests for parsing helpers (e.g., birthDate parse/format, game year detection).
- Linting/format sanity (no external tooling required; optional preconfigured tasks if added later).
- Consider TypeScript refactor if complexity grows (keep offline and simple).

Documentation
- Expand README with per-tab instructions once other tabs are implemented.
- Include JSON path references for each editable field on detail pages.
